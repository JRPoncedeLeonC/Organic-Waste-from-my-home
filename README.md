# Organic-Waste-from-my-home
In this project, I decided to create a list of ten different organic products and measured the weight of each product that became organic waste in grams for fifteen weeks. I captured the data in tables and placed these datasets on a pdf document, just to practice some data wrangling before the analysis process. The aim of the project is to find insights. The wrangling and analysis was done using R programming language.
